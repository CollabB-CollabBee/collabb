# The landing page

This folder contains the landing pages made by contributors. If you want to work on an different version, then you can make a separate folder in the 'landingpage' folder an create your own landing page for the project.

## Note:
Every project should be documented clearly. Preferably use a 'steps.md' document where you document your working flow and the steps you've taken. Wy this is necessary? Because, in case you stop working on your project part, others can see the logical work process. It will make navigating a codebase easier for less experienced developers. The steps.md file is just a list of logical steps, that reflect your thoughts, the development pattern and the way you structured the development process.

### steps.md example
1. opened a githbub repository
2. made initial repository structure with maps
3. created readme.md

### Coding conventions
Please use the coding conventions as dictated to your programming language. A nice article about this can be found at:
