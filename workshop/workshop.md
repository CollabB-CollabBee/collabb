#The workshop space
This space is created for others to see what we are working on. We can switch between project tasks or items. It is a kind of scratch pad space that helps to get started.

## How to use it
Before we have all dedicated spaces set up, you can make your own personal map in this folder. Once the structure gets more visible, the necessary content can be uploaded to the definitive location. Use it as a kind of encouragement for others. Otherwise we will be circling around not getting see progress. It is okay to see exponential growth. So our base will be long and we have to keep at it growing it.
